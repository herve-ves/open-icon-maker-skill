Style definition (icon body only)
- Bold, rounded, friendly UI glyph style

Global constraints (must follow exactly)
- Output: icon body only (no background tile/plate/container, no rounded-square backdrop)
- Format: 1:1 square, centered composition, generous padding
- Foreground: single solid color #000000 (pure black)
- Fill: fully opaque solid black; avoid translucency, shading, or partially open strokes
- Background: transparent
- Flat 2D vector look, not 3D, not photorealistic
- No gradients, no shadows, no lighting, no textures
- No text, no numbers, no letters, no watermarks

Core shape language
- Use thick, uniform visual weight across all elements; favor solid fills, and only use thick rounded outlines when necessary
- Round caps and round joins everywhere; no sharp corners, spikes, or pointed tips
- Smooth, highly simplified geometry; keep total stroke/segment count low (e.g., limbs as single bold strokes, equipment as 1–2 clean primitives)
- Prefer closed, continuous forms; avoid broken strokes
- Express details via a few negative-space cut-outs using rounded holes/dots or 1–3 thick inner strokes; avoid multiple parallel strokes or busy tubing
- No hairline strokes; avoid tiny fragments that blur at small sizes
- Single main subject; avoid secondary elements unless essential

Subject conventions
- People/sports: circular head + thick rounded limbs/torso, simple readable pose silhouette
- Objects/food: thick rounded outline with a clean hollow interior, plus 0–3 simple interior cut-outs
